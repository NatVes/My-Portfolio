# My Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio website! Here, I showcase my skills, projects, and thought processes in the world of web development. This portfolio is created using core skills learned during the frontend web development course. It's more than just a snapshot of my abilities; it's a dynamic representation of my journey.

## Key Features

**Introduction**

As you first land on the page, you'll find my name and a recent photo, establishing a personal connection.

Navigation is made seamless and intuitive. Click on links to explore dedicated sections about me, my work, and find ways to connect. The smooth scrolling adds a touch of professionalism to the user experience.

**Interactive Applications**

In the Work section, you'll find a showcase of my projects. Organized with titled images, the larger size of the top application's image highlights a first project.

Every image is a gateway to the deployed applications. A simple click takes you to a site to explore these projects in real-time, adding an interactive layer to the portfolio experience.

**Responsive Design**

The layout adapts seamlessly to various devices — whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. Responsive design ensures a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience across different screens. 

Here's how it works:

1. Small Screens (Up to 576px): On smaller screens, such as smartphones, the layout prioritizes simplicity and ease of navigation. Content is stacked vertically for a clear and concise presentation, optimizing the user experience for those on the go.

1. Medium Screens (577px to 992px): For tablets and similar devices falling within this range, the layout adjusts to offer a balanced display. Elements are strategically arranged to make the most of the available screen space, providing an engaging experience without overwhelming the user.

1. Large Screens (993px and above): On big computer screens, the portfolio makes good use of the extra space. Everything is laid out nicely, using the wider screen to show my skills and projects in a way that looks good and makes sense.
